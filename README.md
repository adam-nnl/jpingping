jPingPing utility

Small java utility applet that makes use of the JNI (Java Native Interface) to make native OS (Operating System) calls 
for the purpose of gathering network information and statistics from a client-machine to a host without any interaction 
from the end-user (aside from installing Javaâ„¢).

Purpose

It allows for the assurance of client side communication fidelity and latency to a remote server, very handy in many cases 
of network or website diagnostics.
